documenting Odin-Lang learning journey

https://odin-lang.org/

Current learning project. Working through the 2022 Advent of Code using Odin-Lang. 

Took a quick break to get my website up and running. (Got up an running at https://www.ikepatton.com. Still a work in progress, but it's there!

Odin has been a fun language to code in, but it has been a bit frustrating to look up help/documentation with how young of a language it is (still not in Version 1).
In addition, I was hoping to use Odin to get a deeper understanding of languages/computer systems as whole, and this lack of learning documention has made that difficult.
As a result, I have decided to take a break on Odin to learn OCaml which has an incredibly sophisticated learning/documentation system. 

To this end, I have been going through the amazing course: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html. 
The author has requested that solutions not be posted online in order to maintain the integrity of his course. 
If you would like to see my notes or solution attempts, please feel free to reach out, and I can email a zip of those files to you.

In addition, I am hoping to improve my understanding of Data Structures/Algorithms. 
In the past, I went through the Primeagen's Frontend Masters course "The Last Algorithms Course You Will Ever Need."
This was an incredible course, and he used Typescript to implement and test the algorithms.
My hope is to produce a similar Kata Machine using OCaml. My working attempt can be found in my repos.
