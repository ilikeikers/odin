documenting Odin-Lang learning journey

https://odin-lang.org/

Current learning project. Working through the 2022 Advent of Code using Odin-Lang. 

Took a quick break to get my website up and running.
Plus, I've come to realize I fundamentally misunderstood how to do Advent of Code. I'll be refactoring these projects on my next days off.
